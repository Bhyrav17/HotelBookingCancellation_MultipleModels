<h3> Hotel Booking cancellation prediction </h3>

<h2> 1.1 General Info </h2>
Hotel Industry is evergrowing in different dimensions providing customers with all the necessary and luxury amenities. One of the main source of revenue is from their rooms getting booked online. It is a major contributor and an important factor of hotel management.

<h2> 1.2 What is the problem? </h2>
 
 It seems that online bookings, particularly via online travel agencies (OTAs) like Booking.com, Expedia, Traveloka, and Agoda, have made it so much easier and cheaper for anyone to book a hotel room and cancel when the need arises (and even rebook if they find a cheaper deal for the same room). 
 
Cancellations can have a bad effect on the hotels involved. A loss of income occurs as a result of unsold rooms and no-shows. A no-show is a cancellation without notice. It’s like getting stood up by your date who doesn’t give a rain check, except that the tragedy from this is not just your hurt feelings but also your lost sales income. 

Hence, this is a major problem for the hotel Industry


<h2> 1.3 Interested Party and Reason </h2>

The Hotel Management is the interested party in this problem as they are the one's to benefit if they could get to know before hand if a customer will cancel the booking or not.


 Advantages of having a ML model with Hotel Cancellation prediction powers:
  >- The Hotel managers will have a pretty good idea who will cancel their bookings or not.
  >- Based on the cancellation  prediction, the Hotel can take appropriate actions to reduce their cost/revenue.
  >- The model maybe used to evaluate an hotel's performance like  how many times a booking got cancelled? - This can be used to get to the root cause of why the cancellations are happening.
